        "summary": "Add a persistent clickable BullBoost Performance logo banner on every authenticated page (all routes inside the Layout component at frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx). The banner must display the uploaded BullBoost Performance logo image (saved as a static asset at frontend/public/assets/generated/bullboost-logo.dim_760x200.png). Clicking the image navigates to https://bullboostperformance.com/?ref=xprbexxu in a new tab. The banner should be styled consistently with the app's dark automotive theme (dark/asphalt background, styled as a slim clickable strip or card). Place it in a non-intrusive but visible position — either between the TopBar and the main content area, or as a fixed strip above the BottomNav — similar in placement to the existing eBay affiliate banner. The image must be wrapped in an anchor tag with target='_blank' and rel='noopener noreferrer'.",
