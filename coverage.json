Display all three sponsor banners (eBay, BullBoost, Enjuku Racing) side-by-side in a single horizontal row, each as a clickable image banner. Style the row consistently with the app's dark automotive theme (dark/asphalt background, equal-width or proportional columns, slim clickable strip). The banners must remain in their existing placement position (between the TopBar and main content area or above the BottomNav).",
