  "summary": "A full-featured car enthusiast social media app inspired by Instagram/TikTok, built exclusively for car culture under the brand 'RevGrid'. Includes a feed, reels, follow/unfollow system, direct messaging, user profiles, mechanics help section, build showcases with photos, a marketplace for buying/selling car parts, car meet events, likes, comments, a discovery page, the ability for users to delete their own posts and reels, and an About RevGrid page with platform description, support/donation info, and contact details.",

    "Social media platform exclusively for car culture — Instagram-inspired UI/UX",
    "Core entities: Users, Posts, Reels, Comments, Likes, Follows, Messages, Events, Builds",
    "Media-heavy app requiring image and video upload/storage support",
    "App has a gated landing page — users must press login before accessing the main app",
    "Marketplace entity needed: listings (id, sellerId, title, description, price, imageUrls, category, status, createdAt)",
    "Reels support category tags: Street, Stance, JDM, Drift, and other car culture subgenres — stored on the post/reel entity",
    "Larger media uploads may require chunked upload strategy or asset canister (ICP) to bypass the ~2 MB ingress message limit"
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "App header/topbar still displays 'CarGram' instead of the preferred 'RevReel' branding",
    "Follow/unfollow button is missing or not visible next to the profile picture on the user profile page",
    "CreateReelPage is missing the video/file upload input — users cannot upload a video when creating a reel",
    "Post/reel creation flow gets stuck in a loading state and does not complete the upload — users cannot successfully submit new posts",
    "Discovery/Explore page is missing or not accessible — users cannot navigate to it from the bottom nav or any other entry point",
    "App shows infinite loading spinner on mobile — possible startup/initialization error or auth check hang on mobile browsers",
    "Flash intro/landing page is skipped for users with an existing account — returning authenticated users bypass the intro and go directly to the main app instead of seeing the intro first"
