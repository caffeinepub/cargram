      "summary": "Increase the maximum allowed file size for reel/video uploads from ~1.5–2 MB to at least 10 MB on CreateReelPage, update validation logic and error messages, and ensure video preview and base64 encoding continue to work correctly for larger files.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "The file input on CreateReelPage accepts video and image files up to at least 10 MB without showing a size error.",
        "Files larger than 10 MB are rejected with a clear error message stating the new size limit.",
        "Files under 10 MB are correctly previewed (video element for video files, img element for images) and encoded as base64 before submission.",
        "The submission flow continues to work end-to-end for files within the new limit — the post is created and the user is navigated away on success.",
        "The old ~2 MB hard-coded size check is removed or replaced with the new 10 MB threshold."

Replace the error message to read 'File too large — please select a file under 10 MB' or similar. Ensure the file preview logic (video element for video files, img element for images), base64 encoding via FileReader, and the submission flow through useCreatePost all continue to function correctly for files up to the new 10 MB threshold. Verify that the reel category selector, caption, and tags fields remain unaffected."
