  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-73 and REQ-74 largely as specified. TunerShopPage.tsx is created with hero, about/mission, services, closing paragraph, tagline, location, and contact sections. The route is registered in App.tsx and a Tuner Shop entry point (Wrench icon) is added to TopBar.tsx. However, the hero section's subheading text differs from the spec — it uses 'Honda & Acura Specialists · Wenatchee, WA' instead of the required subheading 'Performance-focused automotive shop built for enthusiasts who demand more from their cars.' The file is truncated so full verification of the closing paragraph, tagline, location, and contact sections is limited.",
