  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-63 and REQ-64. REQ-63 is fully addressed in CreateReelPage.tsx with a 10 MB constant, updated error messages, and correct preview/encoding flow. REQ-64 is partially addressed by adding a mediaData field to PostRecord in backend/main.mo and a migration module, but the diff does not show explicit size validation guards or comments documenting the ICP ingress limit consistency in the backend createPost function due to truncation.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-64",
      "requirement": "The backend createPost function returns a structured #err result (not a trap) for any invalid or oversized input, and documents the effective ICP limit in a comment to ensure frontend/backend size limits are consistent.",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff is truncated and does not show the createPost function body. There is no visible evidence of structured #err returns for oversized input or a comment documenting the ICP ingress limit and size consistency between frontend (10 MB) and backend.",
