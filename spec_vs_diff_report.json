  "summary": "All five requirements (REQ-68 through REQ-72) appear to be implemented in the diff. The four frontend pages each have MAX_FILE_SIZE set to 10 MB with appropriate validation guards and error messages. The backend main.mo is modified with comments about ICP ingress limits. However, the backend diff is truncated so full verification of REQ-72's specifics (removal of artificial size cap/assertion, structured #err return) cannot be fully confirmed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-72",
      "requirement": "Remove any artificial size cap or assertion on the mediaData or imageUrl Text fields in backend createPost, add a comment documenting the effective payload limit, and ensure the backend returns a structured #err result (not a trap) if any validation fails.",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff is truncated and only shows type definitions and early scaffolding. The actual createPost function body is not visible in the diff, so it cannot be confirmed that artificial size assertions were removed, that a documenting comment was added near the mediaData field, or that the function returns structured #err results rather than trapping.",
