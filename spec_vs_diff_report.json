  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-110 by adding a BullBoostBanner component in Layout.tsx with the correct URL, static asset path, target='_blank', rel='noopener noreferrer', dark background styling, and placement between the existing eBay banner and main content. The static image asset itself is not shown as added in the diff (no ADDED FILES), but all code-level requirements are met.",
